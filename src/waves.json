  "CODE_DESCRIPTION": "The code uses p5.js to generate a static image composed of multiple vertical deformed lines. Each line is formed by a sequence of vertices whose positions, fill, and stroke weight are modulated by a sinusoidal function of x and y. The function f(x, y) combines sine and cosine components to create angle-based distortions.",
  "GENERATION_METHOD": "Mathematical transformation using sine and cosine functions over a grid",
  "OUTPUT_FORMAT": ["image"],
  "OUTPUT_DESCRIPTION": "A static canvas filled with warped vertical lines in blue tones on a black background, with stroke weight and vertex displacement driven by trigonometric calculations.",

  "CODE_DESCRIPTION": "This p5.js sketch generates layered Bezier curves using Perlin noise for dynamic control point variation. Each execution draws colorful abstract shapes on a black canvas, with optional overlaid source-code text. The layout respects margin boundaries for composition and varies stroke color, weight, and number of steps randomly. The result is a generative artwork based on controlled noise and randomness.",
  "GENERATION_METHOD": "Randomness and Perlin noise for Bezier control points, combined with rule-based structure and color variation",

  "OUTPUT_DESCRIPTION": "A static generative artwork consisting of abstract Bezier curves in varying colors and thicknesses on a black canvas, optionally annotated with random text snippets.",
